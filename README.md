The purpose of the proxy is to load the loader. Essentially, it discovers the loader JAR and all of its dependencies
from the [leaf-loader][1] Workshop mod and will load them instead of the game directly.

It allows for one major thing to happen: the loader is able to load dynamically, allowing for automatic loader updates
directly from the workshop. This provides the most convenience and ease-of-use as compared to manual installation.

### Requirements

- Java 25 or higher

### Installation

To install the proxy, you should be using [leaf-installer][2].
If you want to install it purely for testing in-dev, you can run the `copyToGame` Gradle task.

### Usage

The installer will help you with the following, but if you wish, you can do it manually:

The proxy jar should be placed alongside `projectzomboid.jar` in the game folder.
To actually get the game to use the proxy, you need to add `-javaagent:loader-proxy:0.1.2.jar` to the game's launch options.

If you need help with this, you should read [Startup Parameters][3].

### Configuration

If you use the `copyToGame` task, you will need to set the `LEAF_CLIENT_GAME_PATH` environment variable to the game root.
Otherwise, you don't need any external configuration.

### Development

You can build the project like so:

```shell
./gradlew build
```
